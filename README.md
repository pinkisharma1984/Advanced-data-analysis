This project sought to explore and analyze potential factors contributing to global food insecurity by aggregating data from seven datasets provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations website(fao.org).(https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data). The aggregated raw data consisted of 33 variables and 2240 observations with each observation representing a country and year in the range of 2010-2019.

## Techniques: 
Exploratory Analysis

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing :
The aggregated raw dataset required cleaning prior to commencing with data exploration or analysis. Data containing “NA'', or “0”, or a mathematical operator, such as “<”, was identified and removed from the dataset. 

Used to analyze the data is Linear Discriminant Analysis

Logistic regression
